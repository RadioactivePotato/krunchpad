# Introduction

I will be using the KSGER PD210 Soldering iron, it supposedly can go up to 70W but I'll only be able to get up to 27W since I'm using 9V 3A power supply.

The tip I will be using is a small knife tip that came with the soldering iron.

# Heatset Inserts

This is pretty easy to install, the bottom of the insert keeps it in the hole while I push it in with my soldering iron around 330c

# OLED Display and MCU

After installing the heatset inserts, I began soldering the OLED display, some of the pins have a bit too much solder but it'll work

And then I moved onto the MCU, again, some pins have a bit too much solder, but it's fine

I think it looks pretty good!

# Rotary Encoder

The rotary encoder is a bit harder to solder mainly because the side pins (the wide ones) are directly connected to the housing of the encoder, which is all metal, and it sucks away all the heat from the soldering iron very quickly, but I turned the iron up to around 400c and it works fine at the temperature.

One nice thing about the rotary encoder is that it holds itself in place when soldering, so I don't need to use tape to hold it to the PCB.

# Diodes

Diodes are pretty easy to solder, I just have to bend the pins and slot them into the holes, then open it back up so it stays in place, then I can solder each one.

Once I'm done with each row, I cut the excessive leads off and it looks great

After I was finished, I realised it'd look better if the diodes were on the top side of the pcb lol

# Switches

This is also pretty easy to solder, firstly, I install the keycaps, and then carefully flip the macropad upside down (so the keycaps is on the desk)

And then I solder each switch one by one.

Unfortunarly I can't clean off the flux since they aren't water soluble and I don't have IPA, so they're staying on the board for now (pretty sure it's no clean as well)
